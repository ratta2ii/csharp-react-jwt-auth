## Description
_The purpose of this application is to demonstrate a working knowledge of
authentication, authorization in the context of Json Web Tokens (JWT's),
as well as how to make an application more secure through the
implementation of security headers. In addition to the Auth services,
the project also demonstrates an understanding on how to build, and then
deploy, a full-stack application to production._
